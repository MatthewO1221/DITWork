There will be kickoff meetings the next 3 fridays, these are where the team meets with professors and dicusses what we're going to do for our game. We only have to do one, they'll just be doing them the next 3 weeks.

Week 5 is presentation week, we only have 1 per semester

Weeks 9 and 10 are pre-grading, the whole team will meet with the professors to basically give them an update and get feedback

After weeks 9 and 10 there will be optional pre-grading sessions to get feedback

We'll be getting a checklist next week for our week 5 presentations

There are still a few artists not in a team, they will be assigned to teams with 3 artists

WE NEED TO USE SOURCE CONTROL

Everything needs to be in SVN (including all BFA and BAGD work), except source code which can be in Digipen's Git repo

The programmers are required to use Visual Studio 2022 and the designers are required to use Unity 2021.3.1f1

We have to maintain a schedule, we can use trello for this and the whole team has to use it
