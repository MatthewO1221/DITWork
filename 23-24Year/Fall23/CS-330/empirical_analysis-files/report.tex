In this note we explore the problem of the average value 
of the sum of the maximum contiguous subarray in 
a randomly generated sequence of a given length.

\section{Problem statement}
The {\it sum of a maximum contiguous subarray} of a given sequence 
is a value - i.e. elements are chosen in the same order 
as they appear in the given sequence. The problem 
is to find the largest sum among such subsequences.

An interesting question is -- given a randomly generated sequence
what is the average value of its maximum contiguous array.

\section{Experiment setup}
To generate a sequence of length $N$ each element is independently generated
using uniform distribution of integers in the range $[-N/3, 2N/3]$. For each
$N$ we performed $1000$ experiments. The blue graph below shows the average
value of the maximum contiguous subarray plus-minus standard deviation. The
red graph shows function $(x^1.75)$ which grows almost at the same rate, supporting 
the hypothesis that average value of the maximum contiguous subarray of size $N$
is $O(N^1.75)$.
