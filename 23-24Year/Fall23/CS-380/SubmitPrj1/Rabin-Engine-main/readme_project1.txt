Student Name: Matthew Oliver

Project Name: Run from the Swarm

What I implemented: Most things don't work as intended but what's supposed to happen is you have regular people and soldiers 
who are being eaten by swarmlings, the swarminlings then take the nutrition to the hive in the center and it spawns new swarmlings

Directions (if needed):

What I liked about the project and framework:
Everything works together really well, the use of inheritance is really sweet and the framework was capable of most of the things I needed

What I disliked about the project and framework:
I honestly could not figure out how the decorators were actually supposed to work, I ended up having to scrap all my decorators near the end,
which cost me a ton of time

Any difficulties I experienced while doing the project:
I had to scrap all my decorators and put their functionality into the leaf nodes, I then had to come up with 3 random leaf nodes just to hit the 10,
I also didn't give myself near enough time, almost everything is not functioning as intended and I don't even know if the swarming will count for the
extra credit
Hours spent:
10

New selector node (name):
none

I tried to implement swarming, it doesn't work very well though
