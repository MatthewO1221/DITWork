My experience working on this project:
I really enjoyed this one, it was a lot of fun trying to optimize my algorithm/data structures, even if it was difficult. The pathfinding slide decks,
specifically 2 and 3 were super helpful for this as well, gave me a lot of great ideas and made it very clear what to do.

Hours spent:
Probably about 30
