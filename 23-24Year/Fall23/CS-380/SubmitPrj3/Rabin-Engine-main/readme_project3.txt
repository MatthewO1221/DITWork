My experience working on this project:
I really liked this one, it was simple, super clear what we were supposed to impelement and fun to see working. One critique though is that
the explanations of how certain functions worked were not great. The vision cones for example, it took me forever to figure out that the reason
it wasn't working was because my cos(alpha/2) was in radians but my U dot V was not, because the stl trig functions are in radians. It feels
like that's something that should be put in the comments. Propagate dual occupancy also didn't work because I didn't realize that you had to set
the new value to the original highest or lowest value, not the absolute. So if it was negative the new value should also be negative. That could
be cleared up, there also isn't anything in the powerpoint for dual propagation so some slides on that would have been nice.
